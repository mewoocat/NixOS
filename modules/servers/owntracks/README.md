# Description
My personal OwnTracks server config

# Usage
### Server Setup
When rebuilding, the file `/var/spool/owntracks/recorder/store/ghash/data.mdb` will be checked for existence.  If it doesn't exist then the owntracks-recorder database will be initialized.

This server uses port 8883 for MQTT connection of TLS.  It needs to be port forwarded.

Other than that, everything should be read to go regarding the server setup.

### Client Setup
The TLS certificates used are self-signed so the Certificate Authority certificate (ca.crt) will need to be installed on any clients. Also, this configuration requires a client certifcate to be able to authorize a connection in addition to the username and password.

These certificates are generated at `/etc/ssl/certs/owntracks` by default.

##### Installing CA Certificate
Copy the ca.crt file to the client device and install it.

**iOS Note** The certifcate will be untrusted by default so it should be manually marked as trusted from within Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings

##### Installing Client Certificate
To install the client certificate an extra step is needed to prepare the cert and key.  The OwnTracks client requires the client certificate to be in this password protected format.

```
openssl pkcs12 -legacy -export -in client.crt -inkey client.key -name "Owntracks Client Certificate" -out client.p12
```
To install, copy the outputted `client.p12` to the client device and install it.  It should then be available to use within the OwnTracks client.
*iOS Note* The `client.p12` file will need to have it's extension renamed to `.otrp` in order iOS to recognize it as a OwnTracks app config.
